# Improvement-of-Quantum-Circuits-Using-H-U-H-Sandwich-Techniquewith-Diagonal-Matrix-Implementation
Alhamdulillah!
My one more Research Paper on Quantum Computing having title "Improvement of Quantum Circuits Using H-U-H Sandwich Technique with Diagonal Matrix Implementation" has been published in an international journal with my corresponding Iqra Naz in this paper we have design a technique and algorithm for the reduction of the components in the Circuit of quantum computing and simulate and apply it using Qiskit and named it as "H-U-H Sandwich Technique"
